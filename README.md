When the game starts, you will be prompted to select a difficulty level.

1. Easy: 10 chances to guess.
2. Medium: 5 chances to guess.
3. Hard: 3 chances to guess.
After selecting a difficulty, you will be asked to enter your guesses one by one.

The game will tell you if your guess is higher or lower than the target number.
If you guess the number correctly within the allowed attempts, you win, and the game will display your score (number of attempts and time taken).

After the round ends, youâ€™ll be given an option to play again.
